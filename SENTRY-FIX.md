# Sentry Chrome DevTools Fix

## Issue
The application was experiencing errors when Chrome DevTools was trying to access a specific JSON file:
```
/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json
```

This was causing server-side errors in the Sentry integration, which was trying to handle these requests but returning 404 errors because no route was defined for this path.

## Solution
The fix involved modifying the `hooks.server.ts` file to add a custom handler that intercepts requests to the Chrome DevTools JSON file before they reach Sentry's handler.

### Changes Made:
1. Imported the `sequence` function from "@sveltejs/kit/hooks" to chain multiple handlers together
2. Added a new `handleChromeDevTools` function that:
   - Checks if the request URL includes '/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json'
   - If it does, returns a 200 response with an empty JSON object
   - If not, passes the request to the next handler
3. Modified the `handle` export to use `sequence` to run our custom handler before Sentry's handler

### Code Changes:
```typescript
// Added import
import { sequence } from "@sveltejs/kit/hooks";

// Added custom handler
const handleChromeDevTools = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  // Check if this is a Chrome DevTools request
  if (event.url.pathname.includes('/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json')) {
    // Return an empty JSON response to prevent 404 errors
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({}), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Not a Chrome DevTools request, continue to the next handler
  return resolve(event);
};

// Modified handle export to use sequence
export const handle = sequence(handleChromeDevTools, Sentry.sentryHandle());
```

## Why This Works
This solution works because it intercepts the Chrome DevTools requests before they reach Sentry's handler. By returning a valid response (empty JSON with a 200 status code), we prevent Sentry from trying to handle these requests and throwing 404 errors.

This approach is better than disabling Sentry entirely, as it allows Sentry to continue monitoring all other requests while specifically handling the Chrome DevTools requests separately.

## Additional Notes
- This fix only affects server-side handling of Chrome DevTools requests and doesn't impact any other functionality
- The empty JSON response is sufficient for Chrome DevTools, which doesn't actually need any specific data from this endpoint
- This pattern of using `sequence` can be extended to handle other special cases if needed in the future
