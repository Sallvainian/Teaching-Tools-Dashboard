- [ ] Updates TypeScript types if schema changes
- [ ] Includes migration files for schema changes
- [ ] Updates model converters if needed
- [ ] Tests database operations

### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Uses `supabaseService` for data operations
- [ ] Follows error handling patterns from CLAUDE.md
