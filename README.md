# Teacher Dashboard

A comprehensive web application for educators to manage their classroom activities, built with SvelteKit 5, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## üöÄ Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Core Application Structure**: SvelteKit 5 with TypeScript (strict mode, zero errors)
- **Database Connection**: Supabase PostgreSQL with proper `.env` configuration
- **Authentication System**: Complete auth flow with role-based signup (teacher/student)
- **File Storage System**: Complete file upload/download with folders and sharing
- **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- **Local Development**: Full local development environment with hot reload
- **State Management**: Svelte stores with Supabase integration and localStorage fallback
- **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS with dark theme and custom design system
- **Data Grid**: Handsontable integration for gradebook
- **Error Monitoring**: Sentry integration for production error tracking
- **Performance Monitoring**: Custom performance tracking utilities
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated deployment to Vercel

### üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

#### Database Tables
- `app_users` - User authentication and profiles with role support
- `students` - Student records linked to user accounts
- `categories` - Grade categories (classes) with multi-tenant support
- `assignments` - Assignment tracking within categories
- `grades` - Grade recording with student/assignment relationships
- `category_students` - Junction table for class enrollment
- `log_entries` - Student observation logs (behavior tracking)
- `games` - Jeopardy game storage
- `game_categories` - Game category organization
- `questions` - Question bank for games
- `file_folders` - Hierarchical file organization
- `file_metadata` - File information and ownership
- `file_shares` - File sharing permissions

#### Key Features Implemented
1. **Gradebook Module** - Track student grades and assignments with Handsontable
2. **Jeopardy Game Maker** - Create educational quiz games
3. **Observation Log** - Track student behavior and notes (log_entries table)
4. **Authentication** - Secure login with Supabase Auth and role-based access
5. **Multi-tenant Support** - Users see only their own data
6. **File Storage** - Upload, organize, and share educational resources
7. **Performance Monitoring** - Sentry integration for error tracking
8. **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Zero TypeScript errors with full type safety

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account (or use built-in development credentials)
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Add your Supabase credentials to .env
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Code Quality Commands
```bash
# Run TypeScript type checking
npm run check

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Run both lint and type check
npm run validate

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Database Setup
1. Create tables using the SQL scripts in `/supabase/migrations/`
2. Enable RLS policies (already configured)
3. Set up WebStorm database connection using Transaction Pooler

## üéØ Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Student Self-Registration System**
   - Add join codes to classes
   - Create student signup flow
   - Implement approval system for class enrollment

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Separate teacher and student views
   - Create `/teacher/*` and `/student/*` routes
   - Implement route guards based on user role

3. **Student Grade View**
   - Read-only interface for students
   - Show only their own grades
   - Class-specific grade filtering

### Medium Priority
1. **Data Import/Export**
   - CSV import for bulk student upload
   - Grade export functionality
   - Backup/restore capabilities

2. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Loading states for all data operations
   - Error handling improvements
   - Mobile responsive design

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for stores
   - Integration tests for auth flow
   - E2E tests for critical paths

### Nice to Have
1. **Email Notifications**
   - Grade updates
   - Assignment reminders
   - Parent communication

2. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Class performance overview
   - Student progress tracking
   - Assignment statistics

3. **Additional Modules**
   - Lesson planner improvements
   - ClassDojo remake completion
   - Parent portal

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit 5
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: Svelte stores
- **Data Grid**: Handsontable (migrated from AG Grid)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## üìù Development Notes

### Store Pattern
All stores follow a pattern of:
1. Primary storage in Supabase
2. Fallback to localStorage
3. Optimistic UI updates
4. Error recovery

### Security Considerations
- RLS policies on all tables
- User isolation through `user_id` foreign keys
- Role-based access control (upcoming)
- Secure credential management via environment variables

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run validation before committing:
   ```bash
   npm run validate  # Must pass with zero errors
   npm run build     # Ensure production build works
   ```
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Important Guidelines
- All TypeScript errors must be resolved
- Use Svelte 5 runes syntax ($state, $derived, $props)
- Follow the patterns established in CLAUDE.md
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
