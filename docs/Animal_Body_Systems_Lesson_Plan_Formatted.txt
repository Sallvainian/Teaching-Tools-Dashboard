ANIMAL BODY SYSTEMS - 5 DAY LESSON PLAN

Week of: May 12th, 2025
Teacher: Frank Cottone
Module/Unit: Unit 1: Cells and Organization in Organisms
Lesson Focus: Lesson 3: Animal Body Systems
Grade/Content: 6th grade Science

NGSS Performance Expectations:
• MS-LS1-3: Use argument supported by evidence for how the body is a system of interacting subsystems composed of groups of cells
• MS-LS1-8: Gather and synthesize information that sensory receptors respond to stimuli by sending messages to the brain for immediate behavior or storage as memories

DRIVING QUESTION: How do a swimmer's body systems detect and respond to a starting signal?

DAY 1: CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON?
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ANTICIPATORY SET:
• Display video/photos of swimmers diving off platforms upon hearing starting signal
• Focus question: "How do swimmers know exactly when to dive into the pool?"

DIRECT INSTRUCTION:
• TELL: Systems work together to help animals survive. Swimmers use multiple body systems to dive into the pool after detecting the starting signal
• COLLABORATE: Introduce the Driving Question

GUIDED PRACTICE:
• ANALYZE: Students brainstorm questions about swimmer images in small groups
• Sort questions into those addressing the Driving Question vs. questions for later exploration

INDEPENDENT PRACTICE:
• Each student selects one Driving-Question-related question to research
• Record reasoning for interest in that question

CLOSURE:
• Groups share one key question about body systems to set stage for tomorrow's investigation


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DAY 2: EXPLORATION 1 - MEASURING REACTION TIME
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ANTICIPATORY SET:
• Review Driving Question with swimmer response video
• Ask: "What body systems must work together for this to happen?"

DIRECT INSTRUCTION:
• Explain how animals use sensory receptors and nervous system to detect and process environmental stimuli
• Describe pathway: sensory receptors → brain → response

GUIDED PRACTICE:
• Hands-On Lab: "Measure Reaction Time"
• Students work in pairs to measure reaction time to different stimuli
• Record data in organized tables
• Observe how practice affects reaction time (memory storage)

INDEPENDENT PRACTICE:
• Calculate average reaction times and create data graphs
• Write claim about factors that affect response speed

CLOSURE:
• Share evidence showing how practice affects reaction time
• Discuss implications for swimmer training


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DAY 3: EXPLORATION 2 - RESPIRATORY SYSTEM MODEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ANTICIPATORY SET:
• Ask: "What happened inside the swimmer's body from hearing signal to diving?"

DIRECT INSTRUCTION:
• Explain how animals store information as memory
• Describe swimmer's rhythm memory for starting signals

GUIDED PRACTICE:
• Hands-On Lab: "Take a Deep Breath"
• Create respiratory system model using balloons, straws, plastic tubing
• Observe how muscles work together for breathing
• Connect to swimmer breathing and movement coordination

INDEPENDENT PRACTICE:
• Sketch and label breathing system model
• Explain connection to swimmer diving response

CLOSURE:
• Groups share connections between breathing model and swimmer performance


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DAY 4: EXPLORATION 3 - SYSTEM RESPONSE TO EXERCISE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ANTICIPATORY SET:
• Compare trained vs. untrained swimmer response times
• Ask: "Why do trained swimmers react faster?"

DIRECT INSTRUCTION:
• Explain complete pathway: ear receptors → neurons → brain → muscular/skeletal systems
• Describe how specialized cells (neurons) send information

GUIDED PRACTICE:
• Hands-On Lab: "Measure System Response to Exercise"
• Design method to measure breathing and heart rate before/after exercise
• Observe connections between cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems

INDEPENDENT PRACTICE:
• Graph system response data
• Write CER paragraph explaining how body systems coordinate during physical activity

CLOSURE:
• Share evidence of multiple body systems working together during exercise


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DAY 5: LESSON SELF-CHECK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ANTICIPATORY SET:
• Rapid review: three body systems that work together for swimmer response

DIRECT INSTRUCTION:
• Model CER for Driving Question:
  - Claim: Swimmer's body systems work together to detect and respond to starting signals
  - Evidence: Data from all lab activities
  - Reasoning: How evidence supports the claim

GUIDED PRACTICE:
• Complete sample CER together using Self-Check prompts

INDEPENDENT PRACTICE:
• Finish Lesson Self-Check including CER response to driving question
• Complete checkpoint questions

CLOSURE:
• Optional: Create comic, diagram, or story using vocabulary (stimulus, response, nervous system, sensory receptors, neurons, muscular system, skeletal system, coordination)
