# Future Database Implementation Reference Guide

This document provides guidance for adding persistent database storage to the Teacher Dashboard application in the future. Currently, all data is stored in localStorage.

## Planned Database Features

1. **User Authentication**

   - User registration and login
   - Role-based access control (admin, teacher)
   - Secure password handling

2. **Data Persistence**

   - Server-side storage of all application data
   - Multi-user support
   - Data synchronization

3. **Data Security**
   - Row-level security to ensure users can only access their own data
   - Encryption of sensitive information
   - Secure API endpoints

## Potential Database Solutions

### Option 1: PostgreSQL with Custom Backend

- Full SQL database with relational data model
- Custom Node.js/Express backend
- JWT authentication
- RESTful API endpoints

### Option 2: Firebase

- NoSQL document database
- Built-in authentication
- Real-time data capabilities
- Cloud functions for server-side logic

### Option 3: Supabase

- PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
- Built-in authentication
- Row-level security
- Storage for files and media

## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose Database Solution**

   - Evaluate based on needs and constraints
   - Consider hosting costs and scalability

2. **Setup Database Schema**

   - Define tables/collections
   - Set up relationships
   - Implement security rules

3. **Create Authentication System**

   - User registration/login flows
   - Password reset mechanism
   - Session management

4. **Build API Layer**

   - CRUD operations for all data types
   - Endpoint security
   - Input validation

5. **Modify Client Code**

   - Update stores to use API instead of localStorage
   - Add authentication UI
   - Handle offline/online state

6. **Data Migration**

   - Create tools to migrate from localStorage to database
   - Ensure data integrity during migration

7. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Comprehensive testing of all features
   - Performance testing
   - Gradual rollout strategy
