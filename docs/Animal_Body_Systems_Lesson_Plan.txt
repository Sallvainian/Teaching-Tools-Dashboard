5-Day Science Lesson Plan: Animal Body Systems

Week of: May 12th, 2025  
Teacher: Frank Cottone  
Module/Unit: Unit 1: Cells and Organization in Organisms  
Lesson Focus: Lesson 3: Animal Body Systems  
Grade/Content: 6th grade Science  

NGSS Performance Expectations:
- MS-LS1-3: Use argument supported by evidence for how the body is a system of interacting subsystems composed of groups of cells
- MS-LS1-8: Gather and synthesize information that sensory receptors respond to stimuli by sending messages to the brain for immediate behavior or storage as memories

Driving Question: How do a swimmer's body systems detect and respond to a starting signal?

===============================================================================

Day 1: Can You Explain the Phenomenon?

Anticipatory Set:
- Display video/photos of swimmers diving off platforms upon hearing starting signal
- Focus question: "How do swimmers know exactly when to dive into the pool?"

Direct Instruction:
- TELL: Systems work together to help animals survive. Swimmers use multiple body systems to dive into the pool after detecting the starting signal
- COLLABORATE: Introduce the Driving Question

Guided Practice:
- ANALYZE: Students brainstorm questions about swimmer images in small groups
- Sort questions into those addressing the Driving Question vs. questions for later exploration

Independent Practice:
- Each student selects one Driving-Question-related question to research
- Record reasoning for interest in that question

Closure:
- Groups share one key question about body systems to set stage for tomorrow's investigation

===============================================================================

Day 2: Exploration 1 - Measuring Reaction Time

Anticipatory Set:
- Review Driving Question with swimmer response video
- Ask: "What body systems must work together for this to happen?"

Direct Instruction:
- Explain how animals use sensory receptors and nervous system to detect and process environmental stimuli
- Describe pathway: sensory receptors → brain → response

Guided Practice:
- Hands-On Lab: "Measure Reaction Time"
- Students work in pairs to measure reaction time to different stimuli
- Record data in organized tables
- Observe how practice affects reaction time (memory storage)

Independent Practice:
- Calculate average reaction times and create data graphs
- Write claim about factors that affect response speed

Closure:
- Share evidence showing how practice affects reaction time
- Discuss implications for swimmer training

===============================================================================

Day 3: Exploration 2 - Respiratory System Model

Anticipatory Set:
- Ask: "What happened inside the swimmer's body from hearing signal to diving?"

Direct Instruction:
- Explain how animals store information as memory
- Describe swimmer's rhythm memory for starting signals

Guided Practice:
- Hands-On Lab: "Take a Deep Breath"
- Create respiratory system model using balloons, straws, plastic tubing
- Observe how muscles work together for breathing
- Connect to swimmer breathing and movement coordination

Independent Practice:
- Sketch and label breathing system model
- Explain connection to swimmer diving response

Closure:
- Groups share connections between breathing model and swimmer performance

===============================================================================

Day 4: Exploration 3 - System Response to Exercise

Anticipatory Set:
- Compare trained vs. untrained swimmer response times
- Ask: "Why do trained swimmers react faster?"

Direct Instruction:
- Explain complete pathway: ear receptors → neurons → brain → muscular/skeletal systems
- Describe how specialized cells (neurons) send information

Guided Practice:
- Hands-On Lab: "Measure System Response to Exercise"
- Design method to measure breathing and heart rate before/after exercise
- Observe connections between cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems

Independent Practice:
- Graph system response data
- Write CER paragraph explaining how body systems coordinate during physical activity

Closure:
- Share evidence of multiple body systems working together during exercise

===============================================================================

Day 5: Lesson Self-Check

Anticipatory Set:
- Rapid review: three body systems that work together for swimmer response

Direct Instruction:
- Model CER for Driving Question:
  - Claim: Swimmer's body systems work together to detect and respond to starting signals
  - Evidence: Data from all lab activities
  - Reasoning: How evidence supports the claim

Guided Practice:
- Complete sample CER together using Self-Check prompts

Independent Practice:
- Finish Lesson Self-Check including CER response to driving question
- Complete checkpoint questions

Closure:
- Optional: Create comic, diagram, or story using vocabulary (stimulus, response, nervous system, sensory receptors, neurons, muscular system, skeletal system, coordination)

===============================================================================

Differentiation Strategies:
- ELL: Provide English/Spanish lab instructions, extra time, peer translation support
- SPE: Extra time, visual aids and diagrams, illustrations for concept understanding
- GT: Design own investigations, research Olympic training methods, create detailed nervous system models
